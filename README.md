- 👋 Hi, I’m Minu Kim!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, OCaml, Ruby, Rust, C, and the Unix Operating System. I also am going to take my first course in Cryptography and Computer Network Security.
I have already experience alot of basics in Data structures, memory management (specifically C), and Discrete Mathematics (Mostly Proofs). But one of my goals is to evenutally get an AWS Certification in DevOps Engineer or Security Specialist.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LITERALLY ANYTHING ATP!
- 📫 How to reach me -> kimminu1115@gmail.com 
  Personally I prefer calling or talking in person or zoom call because physically talking is a much better preference, but email is also fine too!
